# Foldable And Expandable List SwiftUI

This project is a demonstration of how to add simultaneous animations of folding and expanding cells while scrolling. In the project, I put a lot of comments explaining the code behind this. It's by no means perfect and it is my hope that others in the community can perfect the animations I've laid out. 

Also, make sure to check out [TimePrints](https://github.com/ThasianX/TimePrints), an app that I'm almost done working on that utilizes this foldable scrolling animations as well as other slick SwiftUI animations.

**The animation is actually much smoother if you run it yourself. The gif just makes it look so fast**
